# Version Tracking

Maintain a version counter that increments with each user request to ensure traceability.

## Semantic Versioning

Use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format:

- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor changes
- **MINOR**: New features
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or major refactors

## Requirements

- Update the Version History table in `README.md` for each version
- Tag releases with the version number
